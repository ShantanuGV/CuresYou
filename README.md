## Overview

**CurseYou** is a procedural graphics engine that generates readable words from real river imagery.

Instead of rendering characters from a traditional font, the engine searches a curated database of river glyphs, evaluates numerous candidate combinations, optimizes their continuity using **Beam Search**, computes a geometric layout, and procedurally stitches them into a single continuous river composition.

Unlike conventional typography systems where every glyph has a fixed appearance and position, CurseYou constructs every word dynamically.

Each generated image is produced through:

- metadata-driven glyph retrieval
- heuristic optimization
- computational geometry
- affine transformations
- procedural bridge generation
- alpha compositing
- raster rendering

rather than traditional font rendering.

# Overview

Typography has traditionally relied on predefined vector glyphs stored inside font files.

CurseYou explores a different approach.

Instead of selecting glyphs from a font, the engine constructs an entirely new composition from extracted river geometries.

Each character exists as multiple river candidates.

The backend then:

1. retrieves all available candidates,
2. evaluates geometric compatibility,
3. searches for the optimal sequence,
4. aligns neighbouring river segments,
5. generates smooth junctions,
6. composites the result into a seamless image.

Every generated word is therefore unique.

---

# Why CurseYou?

Traditional font rendering systems answer a relatively simple question:

> **"Which glyph should represent this character?"**

The glyph already exists inside a font file. The rendering engine simply determines where it should be placed.

CurseYou approaches typography from a fundamentally different perspective.

Instead of asking which glyph should be drawn, it asks:

> **"Which combination of real river geometries best represents this entire word while preserving natural river flow?"**

Every character has multiple possible river representations. Rather than selecting the first available candidate, the backend evaluates many possible combinations, scores their compatibility, computes an optimized sequence using **Beam Search**, and procedurally assembles the final composition.

This transforms typography into a constrained optimization problem instead of a traditional rendering problem.

Every generated image is unique and is computed at runtime.

# What Makes This Project Different?

Most typography and image generation systems fall into one of these categories:

| Approach                     | Used by CurseYou |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Traditional Vector Fonts     | ❌                |
| SVG Glyph Rendering          | ❌                |
| Neural Image Generation      | ❌                |
| Diffusion Models             | ❌                |
| Image Morphing               | ❌                |
| Texture Synthesis            | ❌                |
| Procedural River Composition | ✅                |

CurseYou introduces a different approach.

Instead of generating images through artificial intelligence or rendering predefined vector glyphs, it constructs typography by procedurally assembling real river geometries.

The backend combines concepts from several computer science disciplines:

* Computational Geometry
* Heuristic Optimization
* Beam Search
* Image Processing
* Raster Graphics
* Procedural Layout Generation

This combination allows the engine to generate continuous river typography without relying on conventional font rendering techniques.

# Design Philosophy

CurseYou treats typography as a search and optimization problem rather than a font rendering problem.

The engine separates every major responsibility into an independent module:

* Metadata Loading
* Candidate Retrieval
* Optimization
* Layout Computation
* Stitching
* Bridge Generation
* Rendering

This separation improves readability, maintainability, and extensibility while allowing each stage of the pipeline to evolve independently.


---

# System Architecture

The CurseYou backend is designed as a modular rendering engine where each stage performs a single well-defined responsibility. Instead of tightly coupling rendering logic into one large script, the engine separates metadata loading, optimization, geometric layout, stitching, and rendering into independent components.

The architecture follows a pipeline-based design where the output of one stage becomes the input of the next. This separation simplifies maintenance, testing, and future improvements.

# Project Philosophy

CurseYou treats typography as an optimization problem rather than a rendering problem.

Every generated image is the result of searching, evaluating, aligning, and composing real river geometries into a coherent structure.

The engine prioritizes geometric continuity, visual realism, and modular architecture over predefined artistic templates.
